#WIP Project For Troop 75

This project is intended to replace an aging system which acts as a storefront for our former boyscout troop. The previous iteration was written by John Love using Visual Basic and ASP hosted on an IIS server. 

The new version is a MEAN stack which utilizes MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS. 

#Requirements

This project requires NodeJS and MongoDB installed. MongoDB must be listening on port 27017 currently (which is the Mongo default).

#Install

After ensuring the requirements are met, simply cd into the project directory and run npm install.

#Run
Currently, this project uses the NodeJS dev server which can be started by cd into the project directory and running ```npm start```.
